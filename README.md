# Code_Fellows_Entrance_Project

## Team Members:

- Kellen Linse

## Description and Problem Domain:

HabiTrac is a website showcasing a simple monthly habit tracking app. HabiTracker allows the user to list and track their habits on a monthly basis.

## Version:

The current version deployed to kellenlinse.com is the dev branch of the project.

The main branch is a snapshop of what I was able to get done prior to the 9:00am 11/19/21 deadline.

As mentioned in the test-in exam, due to events outside of my control, I was not able to dedicate the time I would have liked to spend on this site. The development branch shows the site in a more completed form.
